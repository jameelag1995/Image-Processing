Question: The quantization procedure needs an initial segment division of [0..255] to segments,z.
  If a divisionwill have a gray level segment with no pixels, the procedure will crash(Q1:  Why?).

Answer: because when we calculate qi using the formula we need to divide by he sum of the pixels in this segment
so if there are no pixels there that means the sum would be zero which will lead to an error because we cant divide it
by zero.
