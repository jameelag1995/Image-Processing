the more residual blocks I had the better images I got overall sharper and crisper images in deblur which makes it look almost similar to the orignal image, in denoise small parts of the image look more accurate meaning that the more res blocks less noise in the corrupt image but still not as good as the oirginal image , in SR it was more related to how much data the image had lost (which is related to the factor used to zoom out and zoom in) since it was chosen randomly it was a bit hard to notice the difference between different num of residual blocks but in the other hand there was a huge difference (better) with number of residual blocks larger than 1 compared to nn with 1 res block.
