I started with the parameters used in denoise and deblur which didn't give a good results and the graphs function derivatives where not continuous, but i noticed that the more residual blocks I had the image looked sharper so I increased it to 7 after that I started trying out different epochs the more the better so I chose 12 epochs (didn't have much time to try more) and finally I changed the size of the patch and number of channels to 20 and 32 respectively which made the valid loss graph look smoother. so my final parameters are num_res_block 7 epochs 12 patch 20 and num of channels 32
