In SR model I start by making  the image smaller using zoom function with factor of 2,3 or 4 and then I make it larger by the same factor that way we lose some information from the given image which is ideal for training SR model (after making sure that the original image and corrupted one are same shape). I think this is a good method because the NN even after missing some info from the input image can still create  and retrun way better looking image than LR (corrupt) image we had
